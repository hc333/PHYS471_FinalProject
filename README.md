# PHYS471_FinalProject

This is the code for my final research project for PHYS 471.

This code imports and displays data from the Beaufort Gyre Exploration Project. You can read more about the project here: https://www2.whoi.edu/site/beaufortgyre/

The data my code uses is mooring data, specifically MMP data from moorings A, B, and D. You can find these data files here: https://www2.whoi.edu/site/beaufortgyre/data/mooring-data/
